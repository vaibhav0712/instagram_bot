Believe in yourself and all that you are.
The best time to start was yesterday; the next best time is now.
Every journey begins with a single step.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal.
Dream big and dare to fail.
Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.
You are capable of amazing things.
The harder you work, the luckier you get.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Your only limit is you.
Don’t watch the clock; do what it does—keep going.
Believe you can and you’re halfway there.
Stay positive, work hard, make it happen.
Success is a journey, not a destination.
Do something today that your future self will thank you for.
The best way to predict the future is to create it.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
The only way to do great work is to love what you do.
Don’t stop until you’re proud.
What we think, we become.
You are your only limit.
Stay focused and never give up.
Success doesn’t come to you; you go to it.
Work hard in silence, let success make the noise.
Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.
Be a warrior, not a worrier.
Good things come to those who hustle.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
Don’t wait for opportunity; create it.
Keep going. Everything you need will come to you at the perfect time.
Dream it. Wish it. Do it.
Hustle until you no longer need to introduce yourself.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
Do it with passion or not at all.
You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.
Stay humble, hustle hard.
The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.
Strive for progress, not perfection.
